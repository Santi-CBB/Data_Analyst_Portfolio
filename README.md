## About Me
👋🏾Hola!👋🏾

I am passionate about marketing and audiovisual production 📹, where I have spent the last 5 years honing my skills in companies and non-profit projects; to which must be added that I have work experience in the clinical and educational. I have worked in clinics, TV channels and meditation center, which has given me valuable experience in content and paid media manager, production of audiovisual content and, above all, analyzing the results and data of different marketing campaigns 😎. I love working in a team and finding creative solutions to day-to-day challenges in the sector that demands it.

In addition, I would like to mention that I have a great facility for languages. This has allowed me to work in multicultural environments and adapt quickly to different cultures and ways of doing business.

During my master's degree in Data Science I have acquired a wide range of skills and knowledge in the field of data science 🧑🏾‍⚕️. I have learned how to use various data analysis and visualization techniques, Machine Learning and Deep Learning. I have also acquired a solid understanding of the mathematical and statistical fundamentals needed to perform rigorous and accurate data analysis.

Currently, I am looking for new career opportunities in the retail and FMCG sector in the Big Data world 💻 where I can combine my industry experience, passion for technology and language skills to drive business success. 

In addition, I have learned to work with various tools and technologies used in the data science industry, such as Python, SQL and PowerBI. In Python, I have used libraries such as NumPy, Pandas and Matplotlib for data manipulation, analysis and visualization; and others such as Scikit-learn, TensorFlow and Keras to create and train machine learning models.

I have developed skills in data cleaning and manipulation, as well as in interpreting results from machine learning models. I have also learned to work in teams on data science projects, using agile methodologies by collaborating with SoGoodData. I have understood the importance of clear and effective communication of data analysis results and findings to different audiences, including managers, customers and other stakeholders.

I am always eager to learn new tools and techniques and apply them to solve real-world problems. If you have any questions or comments, please do not hesitate to contact me at info.santiagoboada@gmail.com 😊
